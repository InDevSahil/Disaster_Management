# TODO: Enhance Slider with Swiper.js

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update index.html: Add Swiper.js and Swiper CSS CDNs in <head>, restructure .banner-slider to use Swiper classes (swiper-wrapper, swiper-slide), update controls to swiper-button-prev/next.
- [x] Update js/script.js: Remove old slider logic (showSlide, next/prev, interval, keyboard), add Swiper initialization with autoplay, navigation, keyboard, and fade effect.
- [x] Update css/styles.css: Remove old .slide opacity rules, add Swiper overrides for images, buttons, and theme compatibility.
- [x] Test slider: Run local server, verify auto-play, buttons, swipe, responsiveness, and dark mode.
